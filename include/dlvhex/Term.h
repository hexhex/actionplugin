/**
 * Class representing a term.
 *
 * A Term can be a variable, constant or null constant. A constant is either
 * a number, a symbol (alphanumeric character sequence), or a string (= quoted symbol).
 * A null constant is a "don't care" term.
 * The type is determined by the constructor when a Term object is created (see
 * Term::TermType).
 *
 * Examples of predicates with different term types:
 *
 * <table style="border: 0;"> 
 * <tr><td>p(4)</td><td>4 is a number term.</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>q("42")</td><td>	"42" is a string term.</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>foo("$% \"a\\"")</td><td>"$% \"a\\"" is a string term.</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>bar(name)</td><td>name is a constant term.</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>f(Name,s)</td><td>Name is a variable term, s is a constant
 * term.</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>g(X,Y,_)</td><td>X and Y are variable terms, _ is a null
 * constant.</td></tr>
 * </table>
