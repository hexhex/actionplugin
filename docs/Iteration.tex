	\section*{Iteration}
		We introduced the possibility to iterate the process of evaluation/execution of \textit{Action Atoms}.

		An \Iteration is the evaluation of a given hex program with \textit{Action Atoms} and the execution of the entailed \textit{Action Atoms}.

		This feature is very useful and becomes necessary when we want to use \textit{Environment} in a proper way.

		\vspace*{1em}

		The behavior of the iteration process is controlled by means of a \Iteration variable.

		The default value of \Iteration is ``NO ITERATION'' meaning that we won't do any iteration namely the evaluation/execution of \textit{Action Atoms} will be performed only 1 time.

		\vspace*{1em}

		The user can modify this default behavior in 3 different ways:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item from a command line option
			\item by changing some built-in constant values (that override the behavior specified from command line)
			\item by entailing the truth of some built-in action predicates.
		\end{itemize}

		\vspace*{1em}

		The ``value'' of \Iteration can be specified in 2 ways:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item with \verb|--acthexNumberIterations=NUMBER| (command line option)\\
					or \verb|#acthexNumberIterations=NUMBER.| (built-in constant)

				\verb|NUMBER| must be an integer number that expresses the number of iterations that the program will have to do (0 expresses that the iterations must continue indefinitely);

			\item with \verb|--acthexDurationIterations=DURATION| (command line option)\\
					or \verb|#acthexDurationIterations=DURATION.| (built-in constant)

				\verb|DURATION| must be a time duration (expressed in seconds) after which the iterations must end (0 expresses that the iterations must continue indefinitely); obviously at the end of the current iteration (we verify at the end of each iteration if the time is over).
%represented in a string in this format ``h[h][:mm][:ss][.fff]''; accepted delimiters are ``\-:,.''
		\end{itemize}

		If \verb|acthexNumberIterations| and \verb|acthexDurationIterations| are specified both from command line options or both with built-in constant, they must be considered in OR (the program will end when it made ​​the specified number of iterations or when the specified time has passed).

		If \verb|acthexNumberIterations| and \verb|acthexDurationIterations| are specified more than once from command line options or more than once with built-in constant, the program will throw an error if the values that are specified are different.

		\vspace*{1em}

		There are 2 ``Special Atoms'' that can modify the behavior of \Iteration:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \verb+#acthexContinue{b|c|c_p}+

				If this ''Special Atom'' is scheduled when the value of \Iteration is the default value the program executes another iteration;

			\item \verb+#acthexStop{b|c|c_p}+

				If this ''Special Atoms'' is scheduled when the value of \Iteration is set to a value other than the default one the iteration process will end at the end of the current iteration.
		\end{itemize}
